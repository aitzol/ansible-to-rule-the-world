# Ansible to rule the world

Slides of the presentation given at [PySS 2016](https://pyss16.pyss.org)

## Intro

[We](https://www.codesyntax.com) come from a world where we had several servers shared among our clients, and now we are migrating everything to virtual servers with just one application on them. This has created a big issue regarding server management, because suddenly we have +50 virtual servers to manage. To ease that, we have started using Ansible to prepare our servers to deploy our applications.

[Ansible](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ansible/2.1.1.0) is an IT automation tool written in Python that can help you both to provision your servers or to install your applications and update the server configuration easily.

In this talk I will explain how we use Ansible, how the server configuration is done, and I will even create and configure a server live.
